//! Shows the ZKIR text format of the `inner_proof` / `verify_proof` pair.
//!
//! `inner_proof` binds the next prover-supplied inner proof
//! (`ProofPreimage::proof_witnesses`) to a name, and `verify_proof` takes that
//! name as its `proof` input. Both carry a `guard`, which should be the same
//! condition on the two: it decides whether a witness is consumed at all, and
//! whether the proof is actually verified. Alongside it, `verify_proof` takes:
//!
//! - `vk_hash`: hash of the decider-tagged, self-contained `MidnightVK` blob
//!   (the blob's leading byte is the decider tag, `0x00` = `DeciderKind::None`).
//!   The full VK is resolved out-of-band and carried in the IR's
//!   `verify_proof_vks` side-table, keyed by this hash; the canonical text
//!   stores only the hash.
//! - `instance`: the inner proof's public inputs, as ordinary `Native`
//!   operands (variable references or `0x`-hex immediates).
//!
//! A guard is an ordinary operand, so it can be a variable (witnessed) or a
//! `0x`-hex immediate (a circuit constant, in practice `0x01`). Guarded off, the
//! pair consumes no witness and exposes the trivial accumulator, which the outer
//! verifier's deferred pairing check accepts unconditionally.
//!
//! The `vk_hash` here is fake — this test exercises only the text format and
//! round-trip, not verification.
