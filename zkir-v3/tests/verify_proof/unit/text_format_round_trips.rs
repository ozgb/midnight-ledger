//! Shows the ZKIR text format of the `inner_proof` / `verify_proof` pair.
//!
//! `inner_proof` binds the next prover-supplied inner proof
//! (`ProofPreimage::proof_witnesses`) to a name, and `verify_proof` takes that
//! name as its third input, alongside:
//!
//! - `vk_hash`: hash of the decider-tagged, self-contained `MidnightVK` blob
//!   (the blob's leading byte is the decider tag, `0x00` = the Standard
//!   decider). The full VK is resolved out-of-band and carried in the IR's
//!   `verify_proof_vks` side-table, keyed by this hash; the canonical text
//!   stores only the hash.
//! - `instance`: the inner proof's public inputs, as ordinary `Native`
//!   operands (variable references or `0x`-hex immediates).
//!
//! The `vk_hash` here is fake — this test exercises only the text format and
//! round-trip, not verification.
